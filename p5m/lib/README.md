# Sardin (previously MTMpreproc) Perl library

NB! The directory structure in Perl libraries has
semantics, and must be structured in the same way
as the Perl modules encoded in the library. Files
that requires another structure, and that do not 
contain Perl modules, should be placed elsewhere 
in the repo.
