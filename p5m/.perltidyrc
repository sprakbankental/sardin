# These are the standard PBP settings
# The standard PBP settings also have a shortcut
# -pbp, which we use below
#-l=78  # Max line width is 78 cols 
#-i=4   # Indent level is 4 cols 
#-ci=4  # Continuation indent is 4 cols 
#-se    # Errors to STDERR 
#-vt=2  # Maximal vertical tightness 
#-cti=0 # No extra indentation for closing brackets 
#-pt=1  # Medium parenthesis tightness 
#-bt=1  # Medium brace tightness 
#-sbt=1 # Medium square bracket tightness 
#-bbt=1 # Medium block brace tightness 
#-nsfs  # No space before semicolons 
#-nolq  # Don't outdent long quoted strings 
#-wbb="% + - * / x != == >= <= =~ !~ < > | & **= += *= &= <<= &&= -= /= |= >>= ||= .= %= ^= x=" # Break before all operators
#-st    # Output to STDOUT 

-pbp       # Perl Best Practices defaults
-nst       # Needed to overwrite PBP output choice (STDOUT)
-b         # Edit in place and backup
-et=4      # The world may say what it will, 
           # tabs just make more sense (this is SBTal Perl policy overriding PBP)
-bext='/'  # No backups (unless there is an error)
-iscl      # Ignore side comments in length calc
-sbcp='^#|\s##\s' # Identify left adjucted comments as static block comments
-msc=2     # Minimum space to comment. 
-nolc      # Do not "outdent" lo9ng comments (in fact perltidy 
           # instead sets a 3-space indent, which we *never* want)
